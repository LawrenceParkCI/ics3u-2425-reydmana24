    Demonstrate casting between each of the data type. Write down whether it is explicit or implicit
      int to double
      - Implicit data
      double to int
      - Explicit
      int to long
      - Implicit
      long to int
      - Explicit

    Why do you think these are implicit/explicit? (Hint: Think about the size of each data and the type of data)
    Implicit Casting is used when converting to a larger or more accommodating data type that can safely hold the value of the smaller type without losing any information.
	Explicit Casting is required when thereâ€™s a risk of losing information or when converting from a larger type to a smaller type.
